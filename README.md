# BuildPilot 🚧

*This project is currently in progress*

An AI-powered project planning assistant that helps developers analyze project requirements, recommend technology stacks, and generate comprehensive project documentation using intelligent AI agents.

## 🎯 Overview

BuildPilot leverages the power of CrewAI and OpenAI to provide automated project planning and documentation services. It uses specialized AI agents to analyze your project ideas and generate detailed project plans, including technology recommendations, development timelines, and professional README documentation.

### Key Features

- **Intelligent Project Analysis**: AI-powered analysis of project requirements and scope
- **Technology Stack Recommendations**: Get suggestions for the best tools and frameworks for your project
- **Automated Documentation**: Generate professional README files and project documentation
- **Development Timeline**: Receive realistic timeline estimates and milestone planning
- **Architecture Planning**: Get comprehensive project structure and architecture recommendations

## 🏗️ Architecture

BuildPilot uses a multi-agent system powered by CrewAI:

- **Project Planner Agent**: A senior software architect that analyzes requirements and creates comprehensive project plans
- **Documentation Agent**: A technical writing specialist that generates clear, professional documentation

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Python 3.12+**
- **CrewAI**: Multi-agent AI framework
- **LangChain**: AI application development framework
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4 language model integration
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

### Frontend
- *Coming Soon* - Frontend interface is planned for future development

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- OpenAI API key
- Git

## 🚀 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd "AI Agent Project"
   ```

2. **Set up Python virtual environment**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
   # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from main import ProjectPlanningAssistant

# Initialize the assistant
assistant = ProjectPlanningAssistant()

# Generate a project plan
project_name = "My Awesome Project"
project_description = "A web application for task management with real-time collaboration"

result = assistant.generate_project_plan(project_name, project_description)
print(result)
```

### Running the Application

```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```
